## Feedback

* Completeness: 20/20
* Corrnectness: 32/40
* (-2) The experiments on different training sizes is not correct: you should fixed the size of the test set (e.g. 20% of all data), then change the size of the training set (e.g. 100%/90%/80%/70% of the complete 80% training set)
* Writing: 20/25
* exceed the page requirements (5 v.s. 11) (-5) (p.s. you should put all extra things in an appendix. If you are submitting to a conference, exceeding required pages will be rejected directly....)
* Originality: 8/15
* detailed data analysis on the four datasets (+8)
Total: 83%
